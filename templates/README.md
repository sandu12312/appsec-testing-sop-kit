# Templates

This folder contains standardized templates used for:
- documenting test execution (what was tested, what evidence was collected)
- reporting vulnerabilities in a consistent format (title, steps, impact, severity, classification, recommendation)

Use these templates as a baseline and adapt them as needed for each case.
